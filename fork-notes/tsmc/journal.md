# TSMC job search journal

**English** · [繁體中文](journal.zh-TW.md) · [Playbook](playbook.md) · [fork-notes index](../README.md)

A dated, **privacy-safe** record of the TSMC search: what was done, what the system produced, what was
learned. Newest entry on top. Keep the zh-TW twin in sync in the same commit.

## What may and may not go here

| OK to record | Never record |
|--------------|--------------|
| Dates, stages, and state changes (`Evaluated` → `Applied` → `Interview`) | Your name, email, phone, national ID, address |
| Role *family* (e.g. "process integration", "IT / software") | Salary figures, offer amounts, bonus numbers |
| Report numbers (`#012`). They point into your gitignored `reports/` | Interviewer or recruiter names, contact details |
| Scores and which blocks drove them | CV text, cover-letter text, form answers |
| Commands run, problems hit, fixes | Screenshots of portals or emails |
| Lessons learned, process changes | Anything a recruiter told you in confidence |

### 2026-09-26 — Connectivity test from the cloud environment

- **Stage:** setup
- **Done:** Switched the cloud environment's network access to **Full**, then probed TSMC and 104 from a cloud session.
- **Found:**
  - Both sites sit behind **Cloudflare**. A plain HTTP request (curl, and therefore `scan.mjs` and
    `fetch-jd.mjs`) gets a 403 challenge page from the cloud environment.
  - **TSMC careers loads in a real, non-headless Chromium** (`xvfb-run`). It is an **Avature** site: the
    Avature markup is present, `/en_US/careers/SearchJobs` works and reported 797 results. This settles the
    "unverified ATS" note, but `scan.mjs`'s Avature provider uses plain HTTP, so it will still be
    challenged from the cloud.
  - **104 refuses even the real browser from the cloud** (403, 104's own error page). A block on
    non-Taiwan or datacenter IPs is the likely cause, but that's an inference, not proven.
  - Cloud Chromium needs the session proxy and its CA trusted
    (`--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=<proxy CA SPKI>`). Otherwise every HTTPS page fails with
    `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`.
- **Next:** in the cloud, evaluate TSMC postings by URL through the headful browser. For 104, paste the JD
  text. On a machine in Taiwan, retry `node audit-portals.mjs` with the Avature entry.

### 2026-09-25 — Fork prepared for the TSMC search

- **Stage:** setup
- **Done:** Created `fork-notes/` as fork-only documentation and registered it in `config/local-paths.txt`,
  so neither `git merge` from upstream nor `update-system.mjs apply` touches it. Wrote the bilingual
  [playbook](playbook.md) and the configuration snippets.
- **System output:** none yet. `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml` and `portals.yml` don't exist yet.
- **Found:** career-ops ships a Taiwan market mode (`modes/zh-TW/`: labor law, benefits, local job boards).
  There is no 104 provider, so 104 postings go in by pasted URL or JD. TSMC's careers-site ATS is
  **unverified**: the cloud session that wrote these notes could not reach it.
- **Next:** export the 104 resume → `documents/cv/` → run intake → review `cv.md` + `local/cv.zh-TW.md`;
  set up `config/profile.yml` with the language snippet; add the TSMC portal and run `node audit-portals.mjs`.
